Workspaces are now up and running, meaning that you get can get a working MVP built more quickly and with easier customzation using [autodevs](https://changelog.create.xyz/changelogs/autodevs).

## Until today…

If you've built something with our autodevs in the past, you may have noticed that the autodevs worked with some privacy — after giving it your instructions, you wouldn't see any of its work until it had a complete product to show you.

## Moving forward…

Now, about 15 seconds after you give our autodevs some guidance on the app you're trying to build, it shows you a live preview that you can use to better understand how it's thinking about your app's development, and what tasks you'd like to add next.
