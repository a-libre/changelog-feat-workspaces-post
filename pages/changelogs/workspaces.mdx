Workspaces are up and running, which means that you can now get a working MVP built more quickly and with more fine-tuned instructions using our [autodevs](https://changelog.create.xyz/changelogs/autodevs).

## Until today…

If you've built something with our autodevs in the past, you may have noticed that the autodevs did most of their work behind closed doors — after providing your instructions, you wouldn't see any of the dev work until the autodevs finished building a v0.

## Moving forward…

About 15 seconds after you give our autodevs some guidance on the app you're trying to build, our builder now shows you a live preview of your app, which you can use to better understand the autodevs' development process, and what tasks you'd like to add next. 

## Ready to see for yourself?
