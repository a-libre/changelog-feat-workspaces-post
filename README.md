## Writing articles

To write a new blog post, create a new `.mdx` file in the `/pages/changelogs` directory.

### Anatomy of an MDX article

MDX is a superset of markdown that lets you write JSX directly in your markdown files. It is a powerful way to add dynamic interactivity, and embed components within your content, helping you to bring your pages to life.

## Branding customization

Most of the branding elements can be found in `<Navbar>` and `<Footer>` components. To customize these components, update the code in these directories:

- [`components/core/navbar/index.tsx`](https://github.com/Create-Inc/changelog/tree/master/components/core/navbar)
- [`components/core/footer/index.tsx`](https://github.com/Create-Inc/changelog/tree/master/components/core/footer)
